NYC Data Science House Prices Machine Learning Project: Advanced Regression Techniques

<p>Synthesis of machine learning material is the goal of this project. While the dataset is drawn from a Kaggle competition, the purpose is to demonstrate the understanding of machine learning theory.</p>
<p>For this project, we will employ machine learning techniques to accurately make predictions given a dataset. The framework will be through the lens of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</a> from Kaggle. While the primary goal of Kaggle competitions is generally focused on predictive accuracy, we will try to lead our audience through descriptive insights as well.</p>
