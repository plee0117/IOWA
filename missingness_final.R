# 4. Summary ####

# Missing NAs* are missing together but doesn't implying the lack of masonry; only 8 instances, maybe MCAR, can be ignored?
# Only 7 houses have pools; 3 Quality groups; Both columns (PoolArea and PoolQC) can be ignored
# Only 54 houses with MiscFeature; 49 with sheds 2 with 2nd garage, 2 unidentified, 1 Tennis Court; can be ignored
# Fence NA should be converted to 'No Fence'; still questionable whether it should be used with 80% without fences
# Alley NA should be converted to 'No Alley'; possibly should be ignored with 94% without alley
# FireplaceQu NA implies no fire place in property; All properties with fireplaces have a quality listed; replace with 'No Fireplace'; keep
# Garage* are NA together implying the lack of garage, should be replaced with 'No Garage'; keep
# Bsmt* are NA together except 1 unfinished basement MCAR, implying the lack of basement, should be replaced with 'No Basement'; keep
# Electrical missing possibly MCAR, the 1 missing value can be ignored or imputed with 'SBrkr' since 91% are of this type, others are usually in houses built before 1960, this one was 2006

# Impute LotFrontage with mean of LotFrontage of Neighborhood and LotConfig!

# 5. Impute missing values ####
